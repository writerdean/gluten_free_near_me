# Gluten Free Near Me

A web app to find restaurants that offer gluten free food within a 2k radius.

## User Stories

Summertime is here, and it's time to spend time wth friends on the weekends.  This often involves going out for afternoon drinks, which then turns into a spur of the moment dinner resrvation.

For those with Coeliac disease, this can be a frightening experience, especially if the person is not familiar with the restaurants in the area.  Everyone in the group is standing around saying, where should we go to dinner?  And they all turn to the person who has to come up with a restaurant that is suitable for them to eat at.

This app will find the restaurants within a 2k radius that offer gluten free food.  You can check with comments and reviews, and find out if the menus have gluten free items marked, if the restaurant has a seperate gluten free menu, or if the entire restaurant is gluten free!  You can choose a restaurant with relief, get walking directions and visit the web page to check out the menu on your way.

Currently only available in Melbourne.

All restaurants listed are either certified by Coeliac Australia, or have been recommended by members of Coeliac Australia.  

## Built With

* [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)

## Challenges
I would like to add the ability for the use to add a restaurant themselves, and also post reviews on each of the restaurants they eat at.
